qb-dumplocker
High-Security QBCore Resource for DumpLocker

This version of qb-dumplocker is designed with advanced security measures and is not a simple drag-and-drop resource. It provides enhanced protection for your server files while allowing customization through the config.lua file, including admin options.

Installation
Folder Structure:

Create the following folder structure in your QBCore server's resources directory:

plaintext
Copy code
resources/
   qb-dumplocker/
      client/
         client.lua
      server/
         server.lua
      config.lua
      test.lua
      fxmanifest.lua
Configuration:

Open config.lua and customize the configuration variables as needed. For admin options, set Config.RestrictAdmins to true.

lua
Copy code
Config = {}

-- Add any configuration variables here
Config.EnableAntiDump = true
Config.RestrictAdmins = true -- Set this to true to restrict admins from the resource
Update Server Initialization:

Open fxmanifest.lua and add config.lua to the script list:

lua
Copy code
fx_version 'cerulean'
games { 'rdr3', 'gta5' }

author 'Your Name'
description 'Dumplocker resource for QBCore'
version '1.0.0'

client_script 'config.lua'
client_script 'client/client.lua'
server_script 'server/server.lua'
shared_script 'config.lua'
Identify Admins:

In your server.cfg, assign admin identifiers:

lua
Copy code
# Players
add_principal identifier.license:admin1 qb-dumplocker.god # Admin 1
add_principal identifier.license:admin2 qb-dumplocker.god # Admin 2
Usage
To utilize admin options and further secure your server:

Read README.md:

The README.md file contains essential information about configuring permissions, adding more admin groups, and setting up permissions for specific commands.

Set Permissions Using Commands:

While in the server, use the /addpermission [id] [permission] command to set user permissions dynamically.

Allowing Commands to Specific Permissions:

In qb-core/config.lua, find QBConfig.Server.Permissions and add more groups like 'leo'. Then, in your server.cfg, assign principals for these new groups.

Example Command:

If you added a 'leo' group, a command for only 'leo' members can be created:

lua
Copy code
QBCore.Commands.Add('spikes', 'Place spike strips', {}, false, function(source)
    -- Run code
end, 'leo')
Now, your qb-dumplocker resource is not only high-secured but also configured with advanced options for admin control and permissions customization. Adjust the identifiers and conditions as needed for your server setup.
